## Assignment 1 - Python Basics Practice

Course: Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas

## 
Introduction:
This assignment was designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the initial notebooks of the "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas" course. It focused on variables and data types, working with lists, conditions and loops, basic arithmetic operations, and optional exercises related to the sentiment analysis of fictional tweets.

Guidelines:

Ensured that all code cells were run to avoid errors and undefined variables.
Avoided changing variable names or deleting cells to prevent issues during evaluation.
Used the "jovian.commit" command at intervals to save the work on Jovian.ml.
Optional questions were provided for additional learning but were not considered for evaluation.
Problem 1 - Variables and Data Types:

Assigned name, age, and has_android_phone variables.
Created a person dictionary with name, age, and has_android_phone values.
Used a for loop (optional) to display the type of each value stored against each key in the person dictionary.
Problem 2 - Working with Lists:

Created a list (my_list) with a favorite color, the number of pets, and programming experience.
Used list indexing to display information and update the list.
Removed the first element from the list and displayed the number of elements.
Problem 3 - Conditions and Loops:

Calculated the sum of numbers divisible by 7 within a given range.
Calculated the profit made by a travel company based on the cost of flying the plane and ticket prices.
Checked if the company made an overall profit or loss for the return flight (optional).
Problem 4 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis:

Determined the number and fraction of happy and sad tweets in a given dataset.
Calculated the sentiment score based on the difference between the fractions of happy and sad tweets.
Displayed whether the overall sentiment of the dataset was happy or sad based on the sentiment score.
Calculated the fraction of neutral tweets (optional).
